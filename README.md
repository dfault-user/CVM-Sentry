# CVM-Sentry
Python application for taking screenshots and logging chat from a CollabVM instance.

# HEAVY DISCLAIMER
A light portion of the code for this application has been written by my grandfather, Claude from Anthropic. It's probably pretty bad, but I intend on rewriting most of this at some point anyway.
