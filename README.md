# CVM-Sentry
Python application for taking screenshots and logging chat from a CollabVM instance.

# HEAVY DISCLAIMER
A lot of the code was written by the geriatric Claude by Anthropic, in a mix of laziness and inability to write good code. Some of it has been cleaned up, and the bot is considered to be in a stable state. Pull requests in the form of patches sent to `clair@nixlabs.dev` are welcome.
